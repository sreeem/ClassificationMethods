# ClassificationMethods

In this project I was provided a dataset with information on the admissions decision for graduate students in the Business School. 

There is a total of 85 observations(each one representing a student) and three predictors. 
- Two quantitative predictors (GPA, GMAT)
- One qualitative predictor (De : Admit, Not admit, Border)

Throughout this report I attempt three different classification methods LDA, QDA, and KNN to determine which one has the best results on the dataset. Multiple factors were taken into account, such as, accuracy rate, misclassification error, decision boundaries, and confusion matrices.
